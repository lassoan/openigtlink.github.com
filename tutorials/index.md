3D Slicer and OpenIGTLink Tutorial
----------------------------------

> Web Page: [3D Slicer 4.2 Training Page](http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/4.2/Training#OpenIGTLink).

3D Slicer is a free, open source software package for visualization and image
analysis. The package comes with an integrated OpenIGTLink interface that
allows you to exchange various types of data such as position tracking data and
image data with external tools. The 3D Slicer training page provides a series of
courses for learning how to use 3D Slicer version 4.
The portfolio contains self-guided presentation and sample data sets.
Reference manual style documentation for Slicer4 can be found on the Slicer Wiki.
Contact [Sonia Pujol, Ph.D.](http://www.spl.harvard.edu/pages/People/spujol),
if you have any question regarding the 3D Slicer tutorial.

Connecting 3D Slicer with Brainlab Neurosurgical Navigation System
------------------------------------------------------------------

> Web page: [3D Slicer Brainlab Tutorial](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.6/Modules/OpenIGTLinkRemote/BrainlabTutorial)

Brainlab's "IGTLink" research interface allows your research software to import
images, labels and real-time tracking data from Brainlab's neurosurgical
navigation system using OpenIGTLink. This tutorial shows how to connect 3D
Slicer Brainlab's neurosurgical navigation system through "IGTLink" research interface.

Tutorials for Developers
========================

Using OpenIGTLink from 3D Slicer Python Interface
-------------------------------------------------

> Web page: [3D Slicer OpenIGTLink Developer's Information Page](http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/OpenIGTLinkIF)

With 3D Slicer, you can write your own IGT application as a plug-in module using
[Python scripting language](http://www.python.org). The OpenIGTLink Developer's
Information Page demonstrates how to control data streaming through the OpenIGTLink
interface in 3D Slicer. 


Develop Software with OpenIGTLink Library
-----------------------------------------

> Web page: [OpenIGTLink Library Tutorial](http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/OpenIGTLink/Library/Tutorial)

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to use [The OpenIGTLink Library](library.html) for your
software development using the C/C++ language. The library is available free of chage for any purpose, including commercial use.


Integrating Matlab Script with 3D Slicer Using OpenIGTLink
----------------------------------------------------------

> Web page: [New OpenIGTLink Matlab Interface](https://www.assembla.com/spaces/plus/wiki/Matlab_interface)

This new Matlab OpenIGTLink Interface, developed by
[Perk Lab. at Queen's University](http://perk.cs.queensu.ca), enables data
exchange between Matlab and other software through OpenIGTLink. Compared to
[the interface developed in 2008](http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/OpenIGTLink/Matlab),
the new interface does not require MEX, and can be used without compilation.
You may still use the old interface for Octave, a free Matlab alternative. 


Develop OpenIGTLink server/client for Single-Board Computers
------------------------------------------------------------

> Web page: [OpenIGTLink for Single-Board Computers](sbc-igtl)

A Single-Board Computer (SBC) is a small computer built on a single circuit board typically used as embedded computer  in hardware systems. Recently, hobby-oriented SBCs equipped with ARM-based processors have become popular and widely used for the hobby, educational, and research purposes. This page demonstrates how to develop and deploy an OpenIGTLink interface for ARM-based SBC using [BeagleBone Black Wireless](https://beagleboard.org/black-wireless).



ROS-IGTL-Bridge on a Signel-Board Computer
------------------------------------------

> Web page: [ROS-IGTL-Bridge on a Signel-Board Computer](sbc-ros-igtl-bridge)

In this tutorial, we will setup [Robot Operating System](http://www.ros.org/) on an ARM-based single-board computer (SBC), ROS-IGTL-Bridge, and demonstrate communication between a ROS node on the SBC and 3D Slicer on the host PC.
